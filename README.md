# 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict **house prices** using the **Linear Regression** algorithm. By analyzing key numerical features from a housing dataset, we build a predictive model that estimates the price of a house based on its characteristics. This project offers hands-on experience in one of the most foundational algorithms in machine learning.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop and evaluate a **regression model** that can accurately predict housing prices using relevant features such as area, number of rooms, location score, etc.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) *(Replace with actual dataset URL if available)*
- **Attributes** (example):  
  - Square footage  
  - Number of bedrooms  
  - Number of bathrooms  
  - Location/zip code  
  - Year built  
  - Price (target variable)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data handling  
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** – for building and evaluating the regression model

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration & Cleaning
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Explored correlations and distributions

### 2. Feature Selection
- Selected the most relevant numerical features
- Optional: Used correlation matrix and heatmap for feature insights

### 3. Model Building
- Applied **Linear Regression** using Scikit-Learn
- Trained the model on a portion of the data
- Tested it on unseen data

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Metrics used:  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
  - **R-squared (R² Score)**  
- Visualized predicted vs actual values
